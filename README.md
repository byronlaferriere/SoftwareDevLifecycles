How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Asking the '5 Why's' will help me interpret the user needs and implement them into a program. Eliminating wants and establishing needs will help with this clarification process. Creating user-stories gives these needs design and allows for software teams to program the code accordingly.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The agile process seems to be superior in many ways when developing programs. By allowing for less-strict requirement documentation up front, agile provides quicker and more deliverable content early. I hope to continue to incorporate flexibility and agility into all of my future development work, as these attributes will help me become a better programmer.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good software developer is one thing, but being a good team mate is something that many will never learn. From my personal experience talking with some software engineers, they have stressed collaboration and communication above all in the work place. Even when sitting right beside someone, it is still important to have constant communication about what we are working on and how we can accomplish this. Being a good team mate, means perfecting these skills so that I may help the team over come challenges we face when working together.
